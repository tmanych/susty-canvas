# Susty Canvas
This is not a super-lightweight theme, but a semi-super-lightweight theme called Susty-Canvas. As the title suggests, it uses the theme "Susty" (https://github.com/jacklenox/susty) by Jack Lenox and adds various javascripts to generate lightweight graphics in the background. Hereby it uses the HTML canvas object and javascript technology. The aim is to create sustainable websites with Wordpress.

I'm very interested in your opinion on whether javascript and canvas could be an alternative to SVG for creating sustainable websites that still use graphics.
