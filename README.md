# Susty Canvas
This is not a super-lightweight theme, but a semi-super-lightweight theme called Susty-Canvas. As the title suggests, it uses the theme "Susty" (https://github.com/jacklenox/susty) by Jack Lenox and adds various javascripts to generate lightweight graphics in the background. Hereby it uses the HTML canvas object and javascript technology.

I'm very interested in your opinion on whether javascript and canvas could be an alternative to SVG for creating sustainable websites that still use graphics.

The following settings are added by the theme in the wordpress-administration interface (Customizer) to give the ability to change the layout of the graphics:

## In the "Website Information" section:
1. canvas layout: to choose from different graphic icons.
2. quantity/size: to influence the number or size of the icons.
3. SVG Content: for advanced users who want to insert SVG.

## In the "Colors" section:
1. lighten objects: lighten objects in background
2. lighten content: lighten the background of the content
3. background color: which color to use in the background (default: white)
4. color of objects (empty=random)
5. second color (not suitable for all layouts, empty=random)
